# Societies

Based heavily off of the following git (by scartwright91): https://github.com/scartwright91/city_builder_tutorial
The youtube tutorial created in conjunction with it (tag Arachnid56): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI_pvfwcPgQ&list=PLH1GhVAtxussESi-YRCN49mbfLW2rquD5

society-building game

This is primarily being used as a learning experience to continue learning how to use pygame as a framework for game creation.

However, I do intend on turning it into an actual game. The focus will be based around the City object, with the main game loop being the player's interactions
with the cities (politically or economically, which equate to number changes in the cities, which the player can exploit to gain more stuff).

Advice, tips, pointers are appreciated.
